        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>After graduating from radiology school, I began to work as a radiology technologist in a hospital environment. It was there where I got my surgery and in-patient procedure experiences. I then had the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills into MRI, where I learned how to take images using the physics of magnets. As the hospital was growing I had another opportunity to transfer over to the Emergency department where I got to learn Computed Tomography (CT), in a fast-paced high-stress environment I learned how to work efficiently to get the most optimal images for the physicians to review.</p> 
          
        <p>While the health field is fascinating, I find that I love to go fishing, go on a trail ride on my bike, and enjoy the beautiful Florida weather whenever I can.</p> 
        

        <!--Quit my full-time job to pursue this dream, please help.-->

        <p>As I begin to further my journey in life, I've decided to go back to school to learn something new and completely different. So I chose Thinkful as my place of learning, looking forward to connecting with many new developers as I begin my journey into Software Developing.
